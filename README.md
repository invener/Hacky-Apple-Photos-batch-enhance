This is a slightly ridiculous method of batch enhancing photos in the Mac Photos. This script simulates clicking the "Enhance" button and pressing the right arrow key to cycle through photos.

To use:

1. Open the Photos app.

2. Create an album of all the photos you want to enhance.

3. Make the Photos app fullscreen.

4. Select the first photo in the album and hit the enter key to bring up the enhancement menu.

5. Press play, input the number of photos to be enhanced, and watch the magic happen.
